# Graphcore tutorials

These tutorials provide hands-on programming exercises to enable you to familiarise yourself with creating, running and profiling programs on the IPU. They are part of the Developer resources provided by Graphcore: https://www.graphcore.ai/developer.

Each of the tutorials contains its own README file with full instructions.
