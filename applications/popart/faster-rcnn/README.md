## Faster-RCNN
This is a IPU implementation of Faster-RCNN detection framework based on ruotianluo's [pytorch-faster-rcnn](https://github.com/ruotianluo/pytorch-faster-rcnn). This model is based on the original paper "Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks": https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497

Currently, we get 79.7(mixed-precision) versus 80.3(Detectron2, FP32) on VOC, Faster-RCNN C4, Resnet50 training.

NOTE, different SDK versions will influence the mAP slightly.

The instructions to run the model are as follows:

## 1. Prepare working environment

1. Install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
make
```

2. Go to your local version of the examples repo:
```
cd public_examples/applications/popart/detection/faster-rcnn
```

## 2. Download and setup the dataset

You can run `bash prepare_dataset.sh` to install the dataset with one click. Of course, if you are interested in how the dataset is deployed, you can see the step-by-step tutorial below.

NOTE: The data is placed in the `./data` by default. If you donâ€™t like to put the data and code together, you can modify the var $DATASETS_DIR in the script, and you also need to modify `_C.DATA_DIR` in `config.py`.

1. The VOC PASCAL training, validation and test datasets need to be downloaded:
```
DATASETS_DIR=${your_data_path}
mkdir $DATASETS_DIR
cd $DATASETS_DIR
wget http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/VOCtrainval_06-Nov-2007.tar
wget http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/VOCtrainval_11-May-2012.tar
wget http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/VOCtest_06-Nov-2007.tar
```
Extract all of these tars into one directory, which should have the following structure:

DATASETS_DIR
```
DATASETS_DIR/
    VOCdevkit/
        VOC2007/ (from VOCtrainval_06-Nov-2007.tar)
        VOC2012/ (from VOCtrainval_11-May-2012.tar)
```

2. generate data reference files (voc_train.txt and voc_test.txt)
```
python3 split_trainval_voc.py ${DATASETS_DIR}/VOCdevkit/VOC2007
python3 split_trainval_voc.py ${DATASETS_DIR}/VOCdevkit/VOC2012
```

3. merge VOC2007 and VOC2012
We will train on VOC 2007 train+val + VOC 2012 train+val, testing on VOC 2007. This is a popular training method, called 07+12 in many papers. Another 07++12 (testing on 2012 test) requires submitting test data to the official VOC server. Those who are interested can try it by themselves. The mAP of 07+12 should be aournd 79.7 for Faster-RCNN-R50-C4 and Detectron2 is 80.3. 

To train on VOC 2007 train+val + VOC 2012 train+val, we need to put them together.
```
# merge VOC2007 and VOC2012 annotations
mkdir ${DATASETS_DIR}/VOC_annotrainval_2007_2012
cp ${DATASETS_DIR}/VOCdevkit/VOC2007/Annotations_trainval/* ${DATASETS_DIR}/VOC_annotrainval_2007_2012/
cp ${DATASETS_DIR}/VOCdevkit/VOC2012/Annotations_trainval/* ${DATASETS_DIR}/VOC_annotrainval_2007_2012/

# merge VOC2007 and VOC2012 images
mkdir ${DATASETS_DIR}/VOC_images
cp ${DATASETS_DIR}/VOCdevkit/VOC2007/JPEGImages/* ${DATASETS_DIR}/VOC_images/
cp ${DATASETS_DIR}/VOCdevkit/VOC2012/JPEGImages/* ${DATASETS_DIR}/VOC_images/
```

## 2. Train and evaluation

1. get pretrained weights for backbone ResNet-50 and convert to IPU format
The pretrained weights of backbone can be downloaded from here(https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7fNdx_jAqhtbllXbWxMVEdZclE).
Then make a folder named weights and put in it.

```
# The script will convert weights from weights/resnet50-caffe.pth to weights/GC_init_weights.pth 
python3 get_init_weights.py 
```
The weights are from Detectron2(https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2), they are licensed under the Apache 2.0

2. train and evaluate model
For multi-batch, 4 IPUs, mixed-presision training on VOC 2007 train+val + VOC 2012 train+val and testing on VOC 2007, you will get mAP around 79.7 on VOC 2007 test. 
This is a popular training method, called 07+12 in many papers. Another 07++12 (testing on 2012 test) requires submitting test data to the official VOC server. Those who are interested can try it by themselves. The mAP of 07+12 should be aournd 79.7 for Faster-RCNN-R50-C4 and Detectron2 is 80.3. 
```
bash train.sh yamls/mixed_precision_VOC0712_16batch.yaml
```
Also you can try other configs contained in `yamls/`
