# PopART Code Examples

This directory contains a number of code examples demonstrating how to use the Poplar Advanced Runtime (PopART). These include full models as well as examples of how to use multiple IPUs, implement custom ops in Poplar and other key features provided by PopART.


## Contents

- [Block Sparsity](block_sparse): Examples of performing block-sparse computations on the IPU, including the Poplar code for two block-sparse custom ops (matrix multiplication and softmax), which are used to construct a number of examples and test scripts, including a simple MNIST example.
