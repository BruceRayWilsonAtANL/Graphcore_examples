# Code examples for TensorFlow 2

This directory contains several examples showing how to use TensorFlow 2 on the IPU.

- [Approximate Bayesian Computation for COVID-19 modelling](abc_covid_19): This example produces parameter estimates for the modelling of COVID-19 transmissions to enable statistical analysis.

- [Adversarial Generalized Method of Moments](adversarial_generalized_method_of_moments): This example is an implementation of Adversarial Generalized Method of Moments, an approach for solving statistical problems based on generative adversarial networks with a wide variety of applications.

- [Graph Neural Network Example](gnn): This example uses the Spektral GNN library to predict the heat capacity of various molecules in the QM9 dataset.

- [Message Passing Neural Network](message_passing_neural_network): This example uses the Graphcore IPU to evaluate a few popular graph neural network architectures including Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN), Graph Network and Interaction Network. These are all used to predict chemical properties of molecules.

- [Neural Image Fields](neural_image_fields): This example is an implementation of Neural image fields which are a simplified version of neural radiance fields: [NERF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08934).
