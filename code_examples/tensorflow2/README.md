# Code examples for TensorFlow 2

This directory contains several examples showing how to use TensorFlow 2 on the IPU.

- [Approximate Bayesian Computation for COVID-19 modelling](abc_covid_19): This example produces parameter estimates for the modelling of COVID-19 transmissions to enable statistical analysis.

- [Adversarial Generalized Method of Moments](adversarial_generalized_method_of_moments): This example is an implementation of Adversarial Generalized Method of Moments, an approach for solving statistical problems based on generative adversarial networks with a wide variety of applications.

- [Graph Neural Network Example](gnn): This example uses the Spektral GNN library to predict the heat capacity of various molecules in the QM9 dataset.
