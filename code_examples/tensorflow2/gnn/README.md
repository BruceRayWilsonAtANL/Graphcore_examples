# Graph Neural Network

This example uses the [Spektral](https://github.com/danielegrattarola/spektral) GNN library to predict the heat capacity of various molecules in the [QM9 dataset](http://quantum-machine.org/datasets/).

In particular this example shows [Edge Conditioned Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02901) but any dataset or network from the Spektral library should work the same.

## Usage

Install the Poplar SDK following the the instructions in the Getting Started guide for your IPU system. Make sure to source the `enable.sh` script for poplar.  

<<<<<<< HEAD
```python3 -m pip install -U pip```

```pip3 install tensorflow-2*```

```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

```python3 qm9_ipu.py```
=======
1. Update pip: ```python3 -m pip install -U pip```
2. Install the Graphcore Tensorflow wheel: ```pip3 install tensorflow-2*```
3. Install the Spektral GNN library requirements: ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
4. Run the example: ```python3 qm9_ipu.py```
>>>>>>> ss

The above script will download the [QM9 dataset](http://quantum-machine.org/datasets/) automatically which is just about 40MB in size.
